                        engineering. I am a 3rd year student at unitversity of guelph majoring in Software Engineering Co-op and minoring in Enterpreneurship. I have good experience in software development and software testing with
                        a strong focus on problem-solving and debugging. During my co-op terms I have developed a strong
                        understanding of software development life cycles and agile methodologies. I am well-versed in
                        C++, Java, Python, SQL and am familiar with various software libraries and frameworks.
                        Additionally, I have experience with debugging, unit testing and production-level code. I am a
                        team player and believe in collaboration to achieve a common goal. I am excited to join a
                        dynamic team and continue to grow my software engineering knowledge.

        <div class="subText"><span>Camis Inc.</span> </div>
        <p class="newclass">It was a wonderfull experience to work at Camis Inc. There's a lot that I gained while
            working. First of all, I never knew that there's so much going on behind reserving a campsite. Before
            joining, I went through the job descriptiton, I found that there were a lot of opportunities to learn about
            testing and product review at Camis. I designed my goals keeping in my mind not only technical aspects of
            the job, but also business and interpersonal skills. My main tasks was to perform tests on different
            features. Due to different learning sessions and meeting, I was able to achieve my each and every goal.
            Apart from the technical skills, I get to know how to interact with clients and team members at a
            professional level. The experience that I gained at Camis will help me in honing my skills to the next
            level, which will eventually help me to fulfill my future goals.</p>

        <p class="newclass">My experience working as a Software Test Co-op at Intellijoint Surgical was one of the most
            rewarding experiences I have had in my career. I was able to learn a lot about software testing and develop
            a wide range of skills in the process. At Intellijoint Surgical, I was responsible for performing various
            types of software tests on the company's products. These tests ranged from unit tests to integration tests
            and system tests. I was also responsible for writing test plans and test cases, as well as executing them. I
            was also involved in the development and maintenance of automated test scripts. This was done in order to
            ensure that the software was functioning properly and that the tests were being performed accurately. I was
            also responsible for creating and maintaining test databases, as well as reporting any issues that were
            encountered during the testing process. Overall, my experience at Intellijoint Surgical was extremely
            valuable. I was able to gain a great deal of knowledge and experience that I can use in future positions. I
            am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a great team and to be a part of a successful
            organization.</p>
